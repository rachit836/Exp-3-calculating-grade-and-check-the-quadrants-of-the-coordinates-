Experiment No. 3

Aim:

To study and implement different types of operators in C++.

Tools Required:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)



Theory:

Operators are special symbols in C++ used to perform operations on variables and values. C++ provides a rich set of built-in operators categorized as:

1. Arithmetic Operators : Used for mathematical operations.

  Examples: +, -, *, /, %

syntax:

int a = 10, b = 5;

int sum = a + b;


2. Relational (Comparison) Operators : Used to compare two values.

  Examples: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=

syntax:
 
 if (a > b) {
    cout << "a is greater";
 }


3. Logical Operators : Used to combine conditional statements.

   Examples: &&, ||, !

syntax:

if (a > b && b > 0) {
    // true if both conditions are true
}


4. Assignment Operators : Assign values to variables.

  Examples: =, +=, -=, *=, /=

5. Bitwise Operators : Used to perform operations on bits.

   Examples: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>



Conclusion:


By performing this experiment:

You understood the various types of C++ operators and their uses.

You implemented multiple operator categories in programs (arithmetic, relational, logical).

You enhanced your problem-solving ability using expressions and conditional logic.
